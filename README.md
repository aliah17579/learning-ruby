# learning ruby


the branches show a ruby project in its different stages, to help you understand how to build a ruby gem, and have it be used by a ruby web application.

branches in order:

1. project-structure - this is the very beginning of a ruby gem
2. adding-tests - after you have some functionality, time to add unit tests!
3. complete-gemfile  - its got features and is tested, time to build and deploy it to gemfury!
4. webapp-using-gem  - this is a working web application thats got our gem as a dependency, try to use the gems functionality in the app!
5. webbapp-endpoint-get-done - now the apps GET /password endpoint returns a password generated by our gem. neat.
